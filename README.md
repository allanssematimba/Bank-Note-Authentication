# Bank Authentication Deep Learning Project
This project is an exploration of the effectiveness of Neural Networks and Random Forests in bank authentication. The Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository was used to train and test the models.

TensorFlow was used to create a deep learning model and Random Forests were used to create another model. The results show that both TensorFlow and Random Forests are highly effective in accurately identifying authentic bank notes.

### Conclusion
This project serves as a demonstration of the power of deep learning and machine learning in detecting fraudulent activities and maintaining the integrity of financial transactions. Despite the excellent performance of both models, further experimentation and tuning could be done to optimize their performance.
